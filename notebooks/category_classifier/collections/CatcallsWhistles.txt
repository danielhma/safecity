 I am really scared please help. This report is regarding the survey conducted on sexual harassment in different forms in a particular area It's a survey along with safety audit THIS SURVEY IS CARRIED BY SAFECITY (RED DOT FOUNDATION) ALONG WITH ITS SAFETY AUDIT AT STREET MARKETS IN MUMBAI. boys whistling while i walk on footpath I was going to work one afternoon and walking down the road near Maharaja Signal. I saw a group of many men around 10-15 men in this area. They all seemed like they were from the Northern Part of India. I was in a decent salwar kameez covered in a dupatta. One of the men in the group yelled at me saying &quot;I love you&quot; in a very demeaning manner. Again this seems to be politically motivated by the elite white skinned North Indians who consider themselves to be gods and goddesses whereas the brown skinned and black skinned South Indians are creeps and the evil witches of India The white skinned North Indian women are considered innocent and angels from heaven. The problem is because I am a brown skinned woman with blemishes on my skin. So I am called a creep. I wonder who the real creeps are? The men who catcall at the woman and the men who pass sexual advances at a woman at 8 pm in the night or the educated black skinned south indian women who are treated like &quot;naukraanis&quot; by the elite North Indians who consider themselves to be superior to other because of the color of their skin. I wonder who the real creeps are. The men who rape and inflict harm or who women get raped. I wonder who the real creeps are the people who treat women like objects of their sexual desire or the women who have the courage to step out of their homes to educate themselves and fight for their grades? Why doesn't these so called elite North Indians give their rapists a US visa and ask them to educate themselves in a foreign country if they have the courage instead of belittling black skinned South women who have made something out of themselves in the world?

There was this day when I was coming from my tuition and a guy on a cycle whistled and passed a comment. I went for shopping.There 3 guys were standing near a shop.As i approached they first started making facial gestures then started whistling and taking pictures. My friend had gone to her college fest.While there were programs going on various guys came and surrounded her group on dance floor.They started passing comments and then groping and touching.

I was coming back to the hostel, there were two boys on the bike who passed some cheap comments to which i could not respond as the bike passed away. One day in the evening on the road there was less light and an old man was following me till the gate of university and was very indesent to me.

Always when I went somewhere people tried to take photos of me, both men and women.

It happened at Thane station platform Faced lewd sexual remarks about physical apperance. A guy dashed against me while walking on the streets. Its not a safe city for a single woman. Men and boys hanging around outside the station, staring and passing comments on women passing-by. I commute to Kurla from Kharghar daily and some perverts get on the train from Mankhurd and Govandi who not only pass lewd comments to every girl on the station. They do not differentiate between teenage girls or a woman in her late 40's their comments are alike and quite disturbing and fellow commuters say nothing to them. They get down at Kurla and then they start taking their chances while getting on the railway bridge. They always try to grope woman in pretex of crowd and other male passengers chose to ignore even after looking at the shameless act.I strongly feel that there should be separate bridge at all stations for women. A corner opposite Bharat Gas Godown where a group of boys sit and drink freely and litter the place with broken bottles. Sometimes the group is seen drinking in parked cars / auto. Harassment to citizens passing through the lane with comments and abusive language. Patrolling should be beefed up and group to be banned from assembling in the area.

I was walking in the lane adjacent to kasarvadavli naka leading towards Thane Muncipal Garden side between 8 to 10 pm. Boys passing towards the direction I was walking stopped by..checked me out right on my face and drove ahead. I gave a firm rude look but did not get into verbal fight as the lane was not lit. there were very few people passing by. The most surprising thing... I was dressed in Salwar Kameez on one occasion. Alert One - There is a cheap liqour shack prior Haware residential Project via the lane i was walking...the boys were heading in the same direction which means they either belong to the slums nearby or were heading to chill out at the liquor shack. Alert Two - The place ahead of the liqour shack is deserted ... I have noticed rickshaw drivers and other local boys frequenting this place. Liqour is consumed in open.....I have seen it. The road gets spilt in two directions one to haware proect.. the other heads to a valley like place which is deserted....police needs to have their presence felt here.... Alert Three - These lanes are half lit and some spots completely unlit with street lights Please do something asap about this before a rape / crime takes place. The nearest police station is kasarvadavali police station. many thanks for this website....

K.C.College-church gate is having railway colony at back side of the college building, every day men and boys of that building harass college students (girls) by staring, commenting, facial expressions and college professors are not taking action on this.

I am glad that this harass map has come atleast i can vent out my anger and frustration. I hope some or the other action will be taken for that. With the release of the movie, Teesmarkhan. I am targeted wherever i go. I am quite used to the fact, that people who know me start singing the song, &quot;sheela sheela ki jawani&quot;. But i was surprised and shocked to know that some road side romeo started singing this song when i went outside my building to get the rickshaw. I ignored it at first, but this happens quite often. Its not a coincidence, but a harassment. I am fed up of my name. When I would travel by the 271 bus I often experienced of men try brush against me and stare at me. The worst thing is that there are two - three conductors who always try to touch women and they purposely hold the hand of the women when handing over the ticket. This happened with me more that four or five times. One of the entry/exit bridges of Malad station starts/ends near a men's public toilet. There is always a crowd of men standing there and also the path to the main road has a kind of a compound and during mornings or evenings there are boys and men standing there staring at every girl passing by, passing comments, making weird facial expressions and posture, singing songs, brushing against women as they pass by and so on famous Phadke road in dombivali east is proud of people of dombivali but every day evening {especially on Sunday} this is a market of harasser and victim. a group of boys and girls come there for many reason, boys stand in group on road..tease girls.. nobody is complaining about this... groups of men not only passed lewd comments to women passing by, but also engaged in whistling and laughing and sometimes even touching the female commuters.

Recently during the Ganesha visarjan I noticed men staring at me, taking the excuse of traffic and trying to get close to me and my friend who was with me. Not just this even on normal days I find rickshaw drivers staring at me when I wear skirts and rise or even if I'm wearing an Indian wear they still stare. Once on a lonely road a car was driving behind me and kept honking even though the road was empty. Group of boys passes lewd remarks on us when we access this street any time of the day. There are a lot of boys loitering around the park of sitting on the side walls. They passed lewd remarks at the girls crossing the park. The area where i stay, is just pathetic. There are always this boys of group standing on the road side, playing cards and passing comments on each passer by. I try to ignore their comments, but again at the same time i feel why should i ignore. I don't like that girls like me are easy targets to the road side romeos. When i talk to my parents about this they too ask me too ignore the same. But somehow, i don't like to ignore. I want to take strict action against this boys as they really pass dirty comments on the girls. Therefore our parents do not allow us to move out of the house after 7 pm. I am student, studying in a senior college. I and my other few friends have been facing torture from the hands of few boys from our college itself. these boys are affiliated to some political party and highly influential too. They call out our names, pass lewd remarks, our names with some sexual message has been scribbled on the college walls. We suspect on them, how do we resolve this problem???

I'm a 21 years old college going girl living in Sion. It is very difficult and a scary affair almost everyday, anytime of the day. The most dangerous place is exactly outside the station where there is the underground bridge (subway). Most of the time there is no light at all in this dark underground. Besides this, after exiting from the underground bridge and as you walk towards Shivar Guest House, there are always huge groups of men, including shop keepers sitting all along the wholesale clothes shops going towards the BMC Quaters, who not only make lewd remarks, they also make sexual remarks, and sometimes even attempt unwanted contact. Worse cases have been witnessed but no action has ever been taken. This is just not a fixed group, there are always gangs at this entire area and specially at nights, the lane towards Laxmi baug and the BMC Quarters has a lot of mini ladders where these gangs sit as soon sun sets, and the number increases as time passes and it becomes worse at nights. everyday there are gangs of boys sitting exactly outside the entrance of my chawl and they are there from 7 - 11:30 pm and keep harassing all girls making dirty comments and making life miserable. I'm scared of them. PLEASE HELP

Request for a stationed officer there at all times after 8 pm onwards. PLEASE HELP....

I was in a crowded place so there was 1 person who said to me something very disturbing - &quot;chute chatne degi&quot;. Since it was a crowded place and people were pushing each other I couldn't react instantly. By the time I realised what happened to me he had already left. And otherwise also I don't know how I would have reacted even if he was still standing there. I was in a shared autorickshaw. The person who was sitting next to me was trying to elbow me in the stomach. Later he tried to slide his hand under my thigh. I told him to take his hand away and sit in front.

A group of boys were commenting on several women crossing the street outside Saket metro station. A man followed me from the station to my home, whistling and whispered in my ear &quot;charming&quot; before leaving. Navigating everyday is a challenge in Indian Cities. I have lived in Coimbatore, Mumbai, Varanasi and Bangalore and from the morning, every act is geared towards navigating the city. am i going to come home late today, what should i wear, do i have transport or am i using public transport, do i really need to stay out late. every day these are my thought processes. i guess as i am relatively old now, i have figured out ways of avoiding unsafe times and places, but the truth is that there is always a fear of getting raped. The incident happened outside BEL township.My friend and I were on a bike and talking to one of our college friend outside her home in bel township when a taxi stopped by. It was a pearl white Tata Indica Vista (KA.03.AA.5562). The driver started teasing our friend and started abusing us too when we looked at him. He intended to pick a fight on road. But we chose to quietly note his vehicle number down and report. He had two others in his car. After the incident he went ahead towards Yeshwanthpur and proceeded towards Metro. I used to experience other types of categories when I was younger, but am now a veteran in my own city - in the field of avoiding any such issues. 
But ogling, facial expressions and comments remain unchanged over the years.
In every other place i travel to, as I am not a local, I experience all the other categories of assault except rape/sexual assault. 
I have avoided rape over the years by simply NEVER being in a situation that could lead to it.
